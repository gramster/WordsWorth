WordsWorth and XWord, a Scrabble-like game and a crossword
solving assistant, that I wrote in the 1990s. There is an
ealier DOS version that handles its own graphics, and the 
Windows version, which relied on wxWindows. 

WordsWorth is based on the ACM article "The World's Fastest
Scrabble Program", but adds a lot of configureability in the
board, the rules, etc.

One day I will get XWord working again; that was the one of these
I actually used; along with WordFind, my Palm app, these were
awesome for helping with cryptic crosswords when I was stuck.
