Not so easy to see what happened here if you didn't play the game. 
I just decided to save by chance, and WW had made two substitutions,
one an S, the other an I (ie. they were blanks on the board in those
capacities) This was fine, but when I loaded the game, as it stepped
through the moves where it made the substitutions, it substituted the
blanks for A's in both cases. So, they were fine in the original
game, but when reloaded, somehow they just became A's.
