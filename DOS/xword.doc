			XWord v2.4
			==========

(c) 1995 by Graham Wheeler. XWord is part of WordsWorth, and may
not be distributed separately.

========================================================================

WordsWorth v1.2 includes a utility called XWord. This utility basically
provides the same functionality as the CONSULT command in WordsWorth.
However, it also has the ability to generate lightning-fast multi-word
anagrams, blockwords, and includes an interactive crossword solving 
assistant.

XWord is invoked in one of the following ways:

Normal consult:       XWORD [-a] [-A] [-l] [ <dictionary> ]
Multi-word anagrams:  XWORD [-M[<length>[<cnt>]]] [ <dictionary> ]
Blockwords:           XWORD [-B] [-G] [ <dictionary> ]
Crossword Assistant:  XWORD [-X] ( <size> | <layout file> ) [ <dictionary> ]

The default dictionary file if one is not specified is WW.DIC.

Note that you can switch between normal, multi-word anagram
and blockword mode while running XWord, by entering A or L
for normal mode, M for multi-word anagram mode, and B for
blockwords. You can also access these modes from the crossword 
assistant, but you cannot use the crossword assistant unless 
you specified the -X flag.

You can get help in the assistant by pressing F1, and in the
other modes by entering `?'. You can quit the assistant by
pressing ESC (you will be asked for confirmation) and the
other modes by entering `Q'.

In all modes other than the assistant, you can get XWord to
send a copy of the output to the file XWORD.LOG. When you
quit the assistant, it saves the current crossword layout in 
the file XWORD.OUT.

You can terminate the current activity in most modes by pressing
Ctrl-Break. XWord will stop what it is doing and prompt you for
new commands.

In all modes other than the assistant, XWord maintains a list of
the last ten input patterns. You can recall the list by entering
"H", and specify an entry from the list by entering the associated
number in the list. This gives an easy way of reusing past patterns
without having to type them in again. At some stage I may make this
a proper editable history...


Normal Consult
--------------

The -a and -A options tell XWord to find anagrams (like the 'a' 
and 'A' options in WordsWorth Consult). The -l option allows subsets
of the letters to be used (like the `All or Some' option in Consult).
If none of these flags are given XWord will find pattern matches
of the same length and in the same order specified by the input patterns.

There are two forms of the -l option, -L and -l. If you specify
-L, then subsets of letters are taken from the pattern prefix, while
with -l they are taken from the suffix. Thus, to find all words that
start with CAT you would disable anagrams, enable -L, and enter the
pattern CAT????????????, while to find those that end with TION you
would disable anagrams, enable -l, and enter ???????????TION.

During normal consults, the following commands can be used to
modify the behaviour:

	A - Show words matching anagrams of patterns
	L - Show words matching any leading subpattern of pattern
	l - Show words matching any trailing subpattern of pattern
	R - Avoid showing repeats (misses some matches, tho...)

Patterns can use ? for an unknown character, [] for a range of
characters, ! to invert a range (thus [!aeiou] is any non-vowel)
and * in front to force use of a character/range.

The following pattern:

	*[aeiou][!aeiou][!aeiou]

will have the following meanings according to the mode:

	Mode	Meaning
	-------------------------------------------------------
	L	All words up to three letters having a single
			vowel at the start
	l	All words up to two letters having no vowels,
			and three letter words with a single
			vowel at the start
	A	All three-letter anagrams of a vowel and 
			two non-vowels
	AL	As for L, but including anagrams
	Al	As for l, but including anagrams

The following commands can be used to control the output. These
apply to multi-word anagram and blockword modes as well:

 D	pause for one second after each match
 W	Wait for keypress after every 24 lines of output
 F	Log results to file XWORD.LOG

Note that most of these commands are toggles; i.e. entering the
command switches the option on if it was off and vice-versa. Enter
`?' if you want to see what the active settings are at any stage.

When you have the W (wait) option selected, you will be prompted
for a keypress at the end of each screenfull of output. XWord
will actually keep computing another screenfull of matches while
it waits. This means that you can page through the output almost
instantaneously.


Multi-Word Anagrams
-------------------
The -M option causes XWord to find multi-word anagrams which can be 
quite fun (like VEGETARIAN = EATING RAVE). You cannot use CONSULT-style
patterns, only literal words (optionally separated by spaces), as input.
XWord's algorithm is extremely fast!

Quite often there will be thousands of possible anagrams and it
becomes impossible to search out the good ones. There is a
technique to help in this case - look through some of the possibilities,
and select a word you think is appropriate in the final anagram.
Then `subtract' this word from the input, and see what words
can be made from the remaining letters. For example, consider
VEGETARIAN. We see that some anagrams have the word RAVE, and 
decide to use this. This means we must find anagrams of the remaining
letters, namely GETIAN. We find the word EATING. Thus 
VEGETARIAN=EATING RAVE. You can do this striking out process by
hand, or have XWord do it for you. In the latter case, enter the
main word(s) followed by the word(s) to exclude, separated by a 
minus. Thus, in the example, we would enter "VEGETARIAN - RAVE".

Another way of limiting the output is to specify a minumum
word length. Only anagrams consisting of words of at least that
length will then be shown. To do this, follow the M mode command
with a single digit (e.g. "M3" interactively, or "-M3" on the
command line). If you change to some other mode, the minimum
length will be reset to the default value of 1.

A second digit can be used to specify a limit on the number
of words. The default value here is zero, which implies no
limit. For example, "M32" specifies multi-word anagrams of
two or less words where each word is of length three or more.
"M3" is equivalent to "M30".


Blockwords
----------
The -B option (or B command within XWord) enters blockword
generation mode. You will be prompted for a seed word for the
blockword, that will be used as the first across word. 

Here is an example of a blockword, with seed XWORD:

    XWORD
    EERIE
    BLADE
    ESTER
    CHESS

If this takes long with few or no hits, you may prefer the graphic 
`work-in-progress' display, selected with -G (or G). In this case, any 
matches can be automatically logged to XWORD.LOG for later retrieval. 

Crossword Assistant
-------------------
The -X option enters the interactive crossword assistant. You can
create a new board by specifying the size, or load a board layout
from a file. When you exit the board layout is saved to XWORD.OUT -
if you use the assistant you'll quickly figure out the format of this
file. There are three examples, CRYPTIC1.BRD,	CRYPTIC2.BRD, and
CRYPTIC3.BRD, that come with WordsWorth. CRYPTIC2 is a half-done
crossword that the assistant will complete if you use the small 
dictionary; that is, invoke XWORD as:

	XWORD -X CRYPTIC2.BRD WWMED.DIC

Note that the 80,000 word dictionary is specified; if you use the
default large dictionary XWORD will not be able to complete the
board, as there is more than one unique solution available to it.
The demo version includes a version of CRYPTIC2.BRD in which all
words longer than six letters have been marked as dictionary overrides.
XWord cannot complete the board in this case, but it serves as a
useful example nontheless.

Usually the first task is to set up a board. Start XWord with
a board size argument, consisting of the number of rows and number
of columns (up to 19-by-19). You will be shown a board with all black
squares. You now have to enter the layout. Note the blue highlighted
square - this is the board cursor position. You can move it around
the board with the cursor keys. To mark a square as empty, put the
cursor on it and type '?'. To reset it to black, put the cursor on
it and enter '#'. To enter a known letter at a square, put the
cursor on it and type the letter.

As you enter square contents, the cursor moves automatically,
generally following the direction you establish initially
by pressing the right or down cursor keys. An exception is 
when entering a letter, where the movement follows the layout 
of the non-black squares.

It is a good idea to set up the board with just `#' and `?' before
entering any letters. Boards generally have some symmetry - the
following commands can speed up the entry process:

    `    Mirror-reflect top half of board setup left-to-right
    '    Copy left half board setup to right half
    \"   Copy top half board setup to bottom half

Then you should mark any multi-word clues as being multiple words.
Move on to the letters that start new words (other than the first
word) and use one (or both) of the following keys:

    ^    Mark square as start of a new down word (brown)
    >    Mark square as start of a new across word (magenta)

The colour names are the colours XWord uses to display these
squares. If you set both attributes, the color will be cyan.

If you suspect that there are words that are not in the dictionary
(such as proper nouns), you need to tell XWord to not consult
the dictionary for that word. Move on to each letter of the word,
and mark it with one of the following:

   |    Don't limit current square to admiisible down words
   -    Don't limit current square to admiisible across words
   +    Don't limit current square by dictionary at all

These attributes will appear as characters on the board.

Now enter the letters that you know. As you move about, you
will see two things changing. At the bottom of the screen XWord
displays all characters that it believes can be entered in the
current square. If the square is empty, on the right hand side
of the screen you will see up to 10 down words and 10 cross
words that can go through the square. The total number of possible
words across and down is also shown.

What is happening is that XWord is working out all possible
words that can go down and across through that square, and hence
what letters can be placed on the square. When the board is nearly
empty, the number of possible words shown on the right may be in
the thousands. When it is a lot less than that, but still more than
ten, you can step through the entire list by pressing Ctrl-A (for
across words) and Ctrl-D (for down words). After every ten words
are displayed you will have to press a key before more will be shown.
You can cancel this operation by pressing ESC.

XWord provides a powerful global restrictions computation. 
You can get XWord to work out the restrictions for the whole
board repeatedly until no further restrictions are found. Once
you have a few words entered this can be done quite quickly. Use
the backspace key to start a fresh global restriction set. XWord
also computes these restrictions in the background while waiting for
you to press a key.

XWord keeps the global restriction results and uses them
to assist in working out the local restrictions as you move 
around. You can update the global restrictions quickly by
pressing the ENTER key. However, if you open up the board
(by replacing a letter with an empty square, or even a black
square with a non-black square) then the restrictions must
be recalculated from scratch. XWord attempts to do this
automatically when necessary, but just in case, you can 
force a complete reset of the global restrictions by pressing
the spacebar.

If XWord finds that a square can have only one possible letter,
it will display the letter in red, without actually committing
the letter to the board permanently. If you are happy with the
letters in red, you can accept them by pressing the `=' key.

Use ESC to quit the assistant and save the board to the XWORD.OUT
file. Note that red letters are not saved. The save file contains
the dimensions of the board, and the known layout.
Here is an example:

13 13

CHAFF#S.....E
A#.#OMAHA#.#R
N....#GENUINE
A#.#..O..#.#C
SANTA##TEAPOT
TA......#.#.#
AR..#.#.#...P
#O#.#...H...E
.N..K.##A...R
.#.#O.D.R#.#V
....A.O#ACCRA
.#.#L.V.R#.#D
RAMPAGE#ELOPE

There are some limitations, due to the fact that we only have a
single letter to represent each square. Thus if a square contains
a letter and a flag, or more than one flag, not all of the information
can be represented. However, in this case the board can be followed by
additional lines of the form:

<row> <column> <character>

to specify this additional information. The full set of characters
that can be used is:

	.	Empty square
	?	Empty square
	#	Black square
	^	Start of new down word in multi-word clue
	>	Start of new across word in multi-word clue
	+	Do not restrict this square at all
	|	Do not restrict this square in a downward direction
	-	Do not restrict this square in an across direction
	A-Z	Put this letter in the square

Here is an example of such a layout, as saved by XWord to the XWORD.OUT
file:
      
      15 15
      
      ; Created by XWord

      #......#......#
      #.#.#.#.#.#.#.#
      ....#..........
      #.#.#.#.#.#.#.#
      ......#........
      #.###.#.#.#.#.#
      .........#....#
      ###.###.###.###
      #....#.........
      #.#.#.#.#.###.#
      ........#......
      #.#.#.#.#.#.#.#
      ..........#....
      #.#.#.#.#.#.#.#
      #......#......#
      
      
      2 11 >
      6 7 ^
      8 10 >
      8 12 >
      8 13 |
      9 13 |
      10 13 ^
      11 7 ^
      12 6 >
      
Note that saved board files can have comment lines starting with 
semicolons. However, these CANNOT appear before the board dimensions!

You can start an XWord dictionary consultation by pressing `@'.
When you are finished, exit the consultation with `Q' as usual
and you will be returned to the crossword assistant.

Have fun!
