What is WordsWorth?
===================
WordsWorth is a package consisting of two programs, which together
constitute a flexible package for crossword fans and Scrabble players.
The first program is essentially a Scrabble game, although it has
been made much more flexible than Scrabble, in that the user can 
modify the score rules, the board layout, the number of tiles, and 
so on. The full version of the program allows the user to save and
load games in progress, undo and redo any number of moves, get
hints, consult the dictionary with a powerful pattern-lookup
facility, force the program to play a different move, and so on.
Some of these features are disabled in the demo version, which
also has a much smaller dictionary (28,000 words) than the 
registered version (80,000 and 117,000 words). The program features
attractive graphics and supports Hercules, EGA, VGA and SuperVGA 
video adapters. The program is driven from the keyboard rather than 
with the mouse as this is more efficient, although basic mouse support
is provided (tested in VGA mode only).

The second program is a stand-alone version of the dictionary
consultation facility of the game, but includes three additional
features: multi-word anagram generation (the game consult only
does single-word anagrams), block word generation (forming a block 
in which every row and every column is a valid word), and crossword
solving. This last feature is especially interesting. The user can
enter the layout of a crossword board (the layout editor includes
flip/rotate actions to speed up this process), and mark the start of
new words of multiple word clues. Then, as the user solves a clue,
he or she enters the word into the grid. While this is happening,
the program continually computes a set of constraints on the board,
based on the dictionary. For example, the program may determine that
a certain cross word can only be one of a certain subset of words, 
each of which has either an O or an A in the second position. This
fact constrains the set of words which can go down through that
second position, which in turn constrains other words, and so on.
The result of computing these constraints is the set of letters
that may be entered in each empty square of the crossword. As the
user moves around the board, the program displays the allowed letters
for the current square as well as the possible down and across words
that can pass through the square. Once about a third of the crossword
is complete in a particular area of the grid, the program makes it 
easy to find the remaining words, and also fills in any squares that
are constrained to a single character automatically. In some case
the program has correctly completed crosswords that were only
half entered.

Getting Started
===============
To get started, you should install the programs on your hard drive.
You can use a standard UNZIP utility, or use the simple installation
program supplied on the disk. To do the latter, change to the drive
containing the disk (by typing A:<ENTER> or B:<ENTER>, whichever is
appropriate), and type INSTALL<ENTER>. You must then enter the source
and destination directories. The install program should set up the 
source directory automatically, but you may want to modify the destination,
which by default is C:\WW. Alternatively you can specify the destination
directory when you *start* INSTALL; for example "INSTALL D:\GAMES\WW".

Note - if you have a registered version you can install either the
full program or the demo version with INSTALL; if you have the demo
version you must select "Install Demo"; if you attempt to select
"Install Program" you will see an error message.

THIS IS NO LONGER TRUE! With the new big dictionary there is not
enough disk space for the demo version any more 8-(. I haven't
removed it from the install program yet as I want to work around 
this somehow..

Once you have installed the program, quit the INSTALL program 
and change to the directory where you did the install. Type 
SETUP<ENTER> to run the WordsWorth setup program. You must specify
what video adapter type you have. The remaining questions you will
be asked can be skipped at first; just keep pressing ENTER until
the setup program exits (this configures WordsWorth to be much
like Scrabble). Later you may want to run SETUP again and try some
other options. Then you can type WW<ENTER> to play WordsWorth the game,
or XWORD<ENTER> to use the dictionary tool/crossword solver. 

If you don't have a mouse you can navigate around the setup
and install program with the TAB key to move from item to item,
the Space key to select an option in SETUP, and the ENTER key
to perform an action (which is usually "OK" unless you are on the
"Cancel" button).

For full details you should read the files WW.DOC and XWORD.DOC in
the installation directory.

Legal Stuff
===========
These programs are distributed together as one package as they
share algorithms and the dictionary. There are two distributions,
a public-domain `freeware' using a 28,000 word dictionary of words
of up to 6 letters in length and game saving/loadng disabled, and a
commercial `shareware' distribution with two large dictionaries
and all features enabled and unnecessary delays removed.

The shareware version is obtainable by sending an international bank 
draft or money order for R50 (South African Rands) 
(foreign users: US $25 or 20 Pounds Sterling), to:

	Graham Wheeler
	P.O.Box 6680
	Roggebaai
	Cape Town 8012 
	South Africa

together with your name and address, and the media you require 
(1 x 5.25" DSHD or 1 x 3.5" DSHD).

DISCLAIMER: This software is distributed with absolutely no warantee.
	While all attempts have been made by the author to ensure that
	these programs are of a high quality and robust nature, you
	use this software at entirely your own risk.
