Major speedups should be possible when doing recursive consults
if the Dictionary::FindPoolAllocation and  Dictionary::RemoveFromPool(int c)
routines could be eliminated in favour of some additional recursive
processing. 

Alternatively, try deferring the pool check until the word is
complete.

Context-sensitive help?

Change consults to walk the dictionary and test words for matches,
if that isn't what is already being done. Basically we want to
only look at each word once.

Testing! Save the game whenever anomalous behaviour is found.
Fix the save file dialog to add the default suffix if none
is specified.
