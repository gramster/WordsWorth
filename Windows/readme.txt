		Welcome to WordsWorth/XWord v2.2!
			March 1998


What is WordsWorth?
===================
WordsWorth is essentially a Scrabble game, although it has
been made much more flexible than Scrabble, in that the user can 
modify the rules, the board size and layout, the number and points
of tiles, and so on. You can save and load games in progress, undo 
and redo any number of moves, consult the dictionary with a powerful 
pattern-lookup facility, force the program to play a different move, 
and so on.

What is XWord?
==============
XWord is a crossword solving assistant. You can enter the layout of 
a crossword grid (the layout editor includes flip/rotate actions 
and different symmetry settings to speed up this process), and mark 
the start of new words of multiple word clues. Then, as you solve 
clues, you enter letters into the grid. While this is happening,
XWord computes a set of constraints on the board, based on the 
dictionary. For example, XWord may determine that a certain cross 
word can only be one of a certain subset of words, each of which 
has either an O or an A in the second position. This fact constrains
the set of words which can go down through that second position, which 
in turn constrains other words, and so on, in a kind of `ripple effect'
through the grid.

The result of computing these constraints is the set of letters
that may be entered in each empty square of the crossword. As you
move around the grid, XWord displays the allowed letters for the 
current square as well as the possible down and across words
that can pass through the square. Once about a third of the crossword
is complete in a particular area of the grid, XWord can make it 
easy to find the remaining words, and also fills in any squares that
are constrained to a single character automatically. In some cases
XWord has correctly completed crosswords that were less than half
solved.

XWord includes some sophisticated features, including allowing
you to specify that a clue is an anagram, or that it is similar
in meaning to some other word. For the latter, XWord uses `concept
keys', which is similar to using a thesaurus to help you solve
the crossword.

Installing WordsWorth and XWord
===============================

To install, unzip the zipfile if not already done, and run the
SETUP.EXE program.

For further help consult the on-line help associated with each
program.

Getting the Latest Version
==========================

The `home site' of WordsWorth is citadel.cdsec.com, in directory
pub/WordsWorth. This will usually contain the latest version,
which in some cases may be a beta version. However, downloading
from this site can be very slow. Instead, you are recommended 
to obtain the latest `official' release, which should be available 
at various sites on the Internet. A good place to look is on 
SimtelNet or one of its mirrors, in the pub/win95/edu subdirectory.
If in doubt, send mail to gram@cdsec.com; I may be able to 
suggest a good location.

Legal Stuff
===========

These are fully playable versions of WordsWorth and XWord. They
are not crippleware, but nor are they freeware. You may try the
programs for 60 days, after which, if you continue to use them,
you should pay for them. If you pay, I will send you a registration
key which will unlock the dictionary building functions, as well
as provide you with FTP access to larger dictionary files.

The cost of registration is:

* South African Rands R50 per program, or R75 for both (African States)
* UK Pounds #7 per program, or #10 for both (Europe/UK)
* US$15 per program, or US$25 for both (elsewhere)

Registration is done via the Internet; you will need an e-mail
address in order to register. Please send e-mail to gram@cdsec.com 
for further information about how to register. Note that some free 
e-mail addresses are filtered by our mail system to reduce spam mail.
In this case you may need to try a different `freemail' site. Also,
please use the subject "WordsWorth registration" if you want a 
prompt response.
